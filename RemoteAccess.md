  In this tutorial, we're going to be going over how you can log into your CSE 15L account on ieng6. To start, you're going to need to look up your CSE 15L account [here](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php). Log in with the first part of your ucsd email (Ex: ndowd@ucsd.edu --> ndowd), and your PID starting with an A or U. Once in take note of the three letters follwing cse15lwi23. Should look like this.

`cse15lwi23xxx`

Then follow the instructions to change your password. Make sure you remember what you changed it to. The change may take up to 15 minutes to take affect, which will come into play in a bit. Now that you have your information set up, you need to download VS Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Follow the instructions to download VS Code to your computer. Once it is installed, open it up, and it should look something like this.
