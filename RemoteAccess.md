Written By: Nathan Dowd


  In this tutorial, we're going to be going over how you can log into your CSE 15L account on ieng6. To start, you're going to need to look up your CSE 15L account [here](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php). Log in with the first part of your ucsd email (Ex: ndowd@ucsd.edu --> ndowd), and your PID starting with an A or U. Once in take note of the three letters follwing cse15lwi23. Should look like this
`cse15lwi23xxx`
